1;Mesenchymal Transformation: The Rosetta Stone of Glioblastoma Pathogenesis and Therapy Resistance; Despite decades of research, glioblastoma (GBM) remains invariably fatal among all forms of cancers. The high level of inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity along with its biological location, the brain, are major barriers against effective treatment. Molecular and single cell analysis identifies different molecular subtypes with varying prognosis, while multiple subtypes can reside in  the same tumor. Cellular plasticity among different subtypes in response to therapies or during recurrence adds another hurdle in the treatment of GBM. This  phenotypic shift is induced and sustained by activation of several pathways within the tumor itself, or microenvironmental factors. In this review, the dynamic nature of cellular shifts in GBM and how the tumor (immune) microenvironment shapes this process leading to therapeutic resistance, while highlighting emerging tools and approaches to study this dynamic double-edg d sword are discussed. Gliomas account for over 80% of all fatal central nervous system (CNS) malignancy[1] and are the leading cause of cancerrelated mortality among children[2] and adults aged below 34 years.[3] Based on histological properties, gliomas are classified into four classes (grades I–IV), in which grade IV, commonly referred to as glioblastoma (GBM), is the most malignant form with an overall mean survival rate of 12–17 months from diagnosis.[4-9] GBMs are highly heterogeneous in nature and tend to infiltrate surrounding areas making complete surgical resection (first line therapy) practically impossible.[10] The second line treatment for GBM, consisting of radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy, also fails partly due to intrinsic and/or acquired radio and chemoresistance.[10] The histological features of glioma (necrosis, cellularity, vascular proliferation, and mitotic figures) do not reflect the treatment failure and poor clinical outcome.[11] Thus, researchers now are focusing on the molecular features of GBM rather than its histological properties. Large-scale genomic analysis has subgrouped GBM into four main classes, classical, pro-neural (PN), mesenchymal (MES), and neural, although later studies showed that the neural subtype is simply a contamination with nontumor cells.[12,13] Each of these subtypes showed a different degree of sensitivity to therapy, while prognosis corresponds to their molecular and genetic signature.[14] For example, tumors with MES feature tend to have worst prognosis compared to other subtypes (PN and classical).[14] In addition, over the course of the disease progression, GBMs can shift their subtypes from one to another[14] and it is believed that the pro-neural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) is most prominent.[15] Segerman et al. found that, upon radiation and chemotherapy, PN tumors shift to MES subtype ultimately leading to chemo and radioresistance.[16] This PMT is synonymous to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in solid tumors of epithelial origin.[17] Because of the believed glial origin of GBM, this process is typically referred to as glial-mesenchymal transition, or simply mesenchymal transformation/transition/transdifferentiation, and more commonly PMT, since this transition is typically observed in the pro-neural subtype.[11,18] EMT and PMT share similar patterns of cellular properties, pathological features, and molecular marker changes. EMT occurs when tumor cells lose their epithelial characteristics (cell–cell adhesion and polarity) and possess a more aggressive mesenchymal characteristic.[19] Although EMT plays a crucial role in embryonic development and wound healing processes,[19] it was proved to be of significance to tumor cell migration, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to conventional radio and chemotherapy.[20] EMT is also crucial for the development and maintenance of cancer stem cell (CSC), a small niche of cells believed to be responsible for tumor initiation, recurrence, and resistance to conventional treatment.[20] In GBM, this cell subset is referred to as glioma stem cells (GSCs) with neural stem-like properties. External stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, and hypoxic environment induce a vast array of signaling pathways and associated transcription factors (SNAI1, SLUG, ZEB, and TWIST) leading to EMT transition.[21] The same molecular events are also involved in mesenchymal transition in GBM leading to increased tumor aggressiveness and acquired drug resistance. In this context, understanding key players that drive mesenchymal transformation and their relationship with drug resistance and poor prognosis is critical to develop effective therapies against this aggressive disease. In this review, we will discuss recent advances and challenges in studying GBM mesenchymal transformation, while highlighting state-of-the-art tools to study these processes.;clinical outcome|glioblastoma (GBM)|mesenchymal transition|molecular subtypes|therapy responses|tumor microenvironment.
2;DGAT1 protects tumor from lipotoxicity, emerging as a promising metabolic target for cancer therapy ;We recently demonstrated that glioblastoma, the most lethal brain cancer, upregulates diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) to store excess fatty acids into triglycerides to prevent lipotoxicity and promote tumor growth. Targeting DGAT1 resulted in marked tumor cell death by triggering extensive oxidative stress, indicating that DGAT1 could be a promising target for cancer therapy. Over the past decade, cancer cell metabolism has been extensively investigated and significant progress has been made from understanding glucose metabolism to identifying amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, and redox regulation.1-3 Nevertheless, translation of these exciting biological findings into the clinic has been limited. The hurdles include identification of metabolic targets that are also required for normal cell growth, or the quick adaptation to the metabolic inhibition by tumor cells that activate alternative metabolic pathways. In order to find effective metabolic targets for cancer therapy, identifying those that are unique to cancer cells and essential for tumor growth is required. Recently, mounting evidence has shown that de novo fatty acid synthesis is greatly upregulated in various types of cancers, including breast, liver, colon and brain cancers, etc. 4,5 Many pharmaceutic companies have developed inhibitors that target the key enzymes regulating fatty acid synthesis, and some have already entered into Phase I/II clinical trials for cancer therapy.3 However, due to the activation of de novo fatty acid synthesis in many normal tissues and organs such as liver, it is highly conceivable that excessive toxicity could arise during the course of continuing treatment, resulting in adverse effects for patients. Therefore, there is a need to find better cancer therapy strategies to leverage the dependency of cancer cells on fatty acids. Fatty acids are essential lipids that constitute the major components of the cell membrane phospholipids and also serve as important energy resources. Moreover, fatty acids can function as signaling molecules or bind to proteins to regulate cellular function.3 Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that cancer cells activate de novo synthesis pathways in order to provide sufficient amount of fatty acids for tumor growth. Our previous study revealed that cancer cells depend on the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), the master transcriptional factor of the fatty acid synthesis pathway, to promote tumor growth.4,6,7 However, in normal cells, it is known that excess free fatty acids (FFA) can disrupt lipid homeostasis and cause lipotoxicity, leading to cell damage. How cancer cells can maintain lipid homeostasis while avoiding lipotoxicity upon synthesis of high levels of fatty acids is poorly understood. Answering this question may lead to identification of effective strategies to treat cancer by disrupting the unique pathway that maintains lipid homeostasis in tumor cells. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal brain tumor. Over the past two decades, the average survival time for GBM patients has remained about 12–15 months from diagnosis despite aggressive treatments. One of the main reasons for the failure to improve GBM therapy is our partial understanding of GBM biology. Our recent study published in Cell Metabolism8 demonstrated that GBM cells increase diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase-1 (DGAT1) expression to regulate fatty acid homeostasis, channeling excess FFA into triglycerides (TG) and lipid droplets (LDs) to prevent overactivation of fatty acid β-oxidation from inducing oxidative stress. We had previously shown that GBM tumors contain large amounts of LDs.9 Our current data showed that inhibition of DGAT1 blocks TG synthesis and LD formation, resulting in fatty acids overfeeding mitochondria and marked production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage mitochondria and induce apoptosis to kill GBM cells. Moreover, inhibiting DGAT1 also significantly affected membrane structural lipids, increasing the flow from fatty acids to the major membrane lipids, phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), while reducing the flux toward phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). Moreover, ceramide levels were also increased upon DGAT1 inhibition. Therefore, although it is clear that overactivation of fatty acid oxidation causing high levels of ROS and mitochondrial damage is sufficient to induce GBM cell apoptosis, we cannot rule out the contribution of membrane lipid dysregulation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to the induction of cell death by DGAT1 inhibition. Moreover, high levels of ROS can also cause lipid oxidation to trigger ferroptosis. Thus, dysregulated membrane lipids, ER stress, and lipid oxidation may strongly potentiate the toxic effects of oxidative stress upon DGAT1 inhibition to induce cancer cell death (Figure 1). In humans, the major sites for TG synthesis are the adipose tissues and liver, where this process is regulated by the DGAT1 and DGAT2 enzymes. In the current study,8 we showed that expression of DGAT1 is much higher than that of DGAT2 in GBM. In contrast, DGAT1 expression is very low in normal brain tissues, where TG and LDs are rarely formed. Thus, targeting DGAT1 is likely to specifically exert toxic effects in GBM tumor tissues, while sparing normal brain and other organs. Through the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analysis, we found that the transcription level of DGAT1 gene is very high in most types of tumors, including ovarian, prostate, breast, liver, lung, head and neck, melanoma, pancreas, sarcoma, cervical, thymoma, thyroid, and renal cancer.8 Importantly, LDs have also been observed in multiple types of cancers.10 Thus, blocking TG synthesis via DGAT1 targeting may have high therapeutic potential for a broad range of cancers. In addition, we found that GBM cells are more sensitive to DGAT1 pharmacological inhibition under hypoxia than normoxia conditions, and DGAT1 inhibition also induced mitochondrial damage and elevated ROS under hypoxia (data not shown), further supporting DGAT1 is a promising target for cancer therapy as hypoxia frequently occurs in growing tumors.;DGAT1|glioblastoma|lipotoxicity|oxidative stress|triglycerides|cancer
3;Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy in Preclinical GL261 Glioblastoma: Influence of Therapeutic Parameters and Non-Invasive Response Biomarker Assessment with MRSI-Based Approaches.; Glioblastomas (GBs) are malignant brain tumours with poor prognosis even after aggressive therapy. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint blockade is  a promising strategy in many types of cancer, but its therapeutic effects in GB remain low and associated with immune infiltration. Previous work suggests that oscillations of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI)-based response pattern with chemotherapy could act as a biomarker of efficient immune system attack onto GBs. The presence of such oscillations with other monotherapies such as anti-PD-1 would reinforce its monitoring potential. Here, we confirm that the  oscillatory behaviour of the response biomarker is also detected in mice treated with anti PD-1 immunotherapy both in combination with temozolomide and as monotherapy. This indicates that the spectral pattern changes observed during therapy response are shared by different therapeutic strategies, provided the host immune system is elicited and able to productively attack tumour cells. Moreover, the participation of the immune system in response is also supported by the rate of cured animals observed with different therapeutic strategies (in the range of 50-100% depending on the treatment), which also held long-term immune memory against tumour cells re-challenge. Taken together, our findings open the way for a translational use of the MRSI-based biomarker in patient-tailored GB therapy, including immunotherapy, for which reliable non-invasive biomakers are still missing. Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary malignant tumour of the central nervous system (CNS) in adults. Clinically, the 5-year survival rate of patients with GB is less than 9%, and the median survival time of them is only around 15 months despite the availability of multimodal therapies [1]. Standard therapy for GB is composed of surgical resection, radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ), but this standard schedule does not prevent tumour recurrence, mostly due to the infiltrative growth pattern, and chemoresistance [2,3]. In recent years, an increasing number of studies indicated that immune escape has played an important role in tumour progression [4–6]. In other words, resistance to chemotherapy is not only related to the intrinsic properties of tumour cells but also to other parameters of the tumour microenvironment [7]. Tumours have evolved in multiple ways to evade the immune system by creating a strong immunosuppressive microenvironment, which protects tumour cells from the immune attack by exploiting inhibitory immune checkpoints such as the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) axis, using check point inhibitors (CKI) [8]. Ultimately, the final phase of escape from immune surveillance allows tumour cells to thrive unchecked in an immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment. With the rapid development of immunotherapy, several anti PD-1 antibodies are being extensively used in clinics. These were approved in the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and bladder cancer [9–12]. Moreover, anti-PD-1 immunotherapeutic approaches are currently undergoing clinical study for safety and efficacy in GB [13], with some success when used in a neoadjuvant approach [13,14]. Unfortunately, the combination therapy of anti-PD-1 and classical radiotherapy does not seem to provide benefit for progression free survival (PFS) in the interim report of the CheckMate-548 Phase 3 clinical trial [15]. This indicates that additional preclinical work may be needed to optimize CKI potential for GB treatment in patients. In this respect, preclinical studies revealed that anti-PD-1 monotherapy exhibits considerable potential for enhancing an anti-tumour immune response in the GL261 immune-competent mouse model [16–18]. However, the overall survival (OSs) of mice under anti-PD-1 monotherapy was quite variable among those studies, possibly due to their different dosing scheme and therapy starting days (i.e., small, large tumours). In this sense, we found it relevant to assess the impact of initial tumour volume and dosing schedule on the anti-PD-1 monotherapy efficacy. In addition, immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with the gold standard chemotherapy (TMZ) could represent another way to enhance treatment efficiency for GB. In preclinical studies, the combination of anti PD-1 antibody and localized radiation therapy has proved to prolong survival in a GL261 immune-competent mouse model [17]. Moreover, the combination therapy of anti-PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drug (carmustine) greatly shrank tumour size and improved survival rate in the GL261 immune-competent mouse model [19]. Our previous work [20] found that PD-L1 content was significantly increased in late relapsing TMZ-treated tumours compared to vehicle-treated tumours, which reveals that the upregulated expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells could be a potential link between chemotherapy and tumour immune resistance. Therefore, we should expect an improved therapeutic potency when anti-PD-1 treatment is combined with TMZ in an immune-enhancing metronomic schedule (IMS) in GL261 immune-competent mice. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in GB detection, treatment planning, and therapy response assessment, evaluating tumour presence, size and characteristics in a non-invasive way [21]. MRI provides anatomical information and other data such as contrast enhancement or biophysical parameters (e.g., perfusion). On the other hand, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or its multivolume variation, spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), provides additional information about millimolar concentrations of low molecular weight metabolites in the studied tissue [22–24], which can inform about its biochemical/molecular environment. Previous studies from our group suggest that the proper analysis of such metabolomic information could give hints about tumour response before changes are observed in tumour size [25,26]. Given TMZ administered in an IMS has produced an oscillatory pattern of response sampled by MRSI-based nosological images, and this oscillatory pattern of response has been proposed to behave as an immune system efficiency biomarker during GB therapy follow-up [20]. In this study, we checked the robustness of the biomarker under different therapeutic options, namely the presence of an oscillatory pattern of response to therapy in tumours treated with IMS-anti-PD-1 monotherapy and IMS-TMZ/anti-PD-1 combination therapy. In the present clinical landscape, patients with GB always relapse even after the best accepted therapeutic protocols are applied, including surgical resection. Accordingly, both response improvement and the generation of tumour-specific immunological memory would be crucial to improve prognosis. Thus, we tested how the different treatment modalities had an impact on tumour recurrence after curing mice and whether MRSI-based nosological images previously developed to monitor the response to TMZ treatment could also reflect tumour response to immunotherapeutic strategies, acting as a generic surrogate biomarker of therapy response.;TMZ|checkpoint inhibitors|glioblastoma|long-term immune memory|magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging|orthotopic immunocompetent tumours|therapy response biomarker.
4;Recent Updates on the Relationship between Cancer and Autoimmune Pancreatitis;Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is now considered a pancreatic manifestation of a newly proposed disease condition, IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). IgG4-RD is characterized by enhanced IgG4 antibody responses and multiple organ involvements. Recent epidemiological studies have addressed the incidence of cancer in patients with AIP and/or IgG4-RD. Surprisingly, a significant number of AIP patients were detected with cancer at or within one year of the diagnosis of AIP. Furthermore, around 50% of all cancers detected in AIP patients comprised mainly 3 types (gastric, lung, and prostate cancer). Thus, AIP appears to be associated with cancer of other organs rather than the pancreas itself, which suggests that AIP is not a pre-cancerous condition of the pancreas. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of cancer and AIP in many patients has led to the establishment of an attractive concept that AIP might sometimes arise from co-existing cancers as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a unique form of chronic pancreatitis in which autoimmunity against as-yetunidentified auto antigens (Ags) underlie the chronic fibroinflammatory responses in the pancreas (1). AIP is now classified into type 1 AIP and type 2 AIP based on clinical features, pathological findings, and IgG4 antibody (Ab) responses (2). It is generally accepted that type 1 AIP, also called lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis, is a pancreatic manifestation of the systemic IgG4- related disease (IgG4-RD). IgG4-RD is a newly established disease characterized by elevated serum levels of IgG4 Ab and multiple organ involvements (3, 4). Massive infiltration of IgG4-expressing plasmacytes into the affected organs, accompanied by storiform fibrosis, is a prominent pathological feature of type 1 AIP (3-5). Gastroenterologists and clinical immunologists have established the diagnostic criteria based on a substantial expansion of awareness and recognition of IgG4-RD by physicians (3-5). A wide variety of single-organ diseases, such as AIP, sialoadenitis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis, are now regarded as organ-specific manifestations of this systemic autoimmune disorder (3-5). As the number of patients with IgG4-RD and type 1 AIP increases, gastroenterologists and clinical immunologists promote further their investigations of type 1 AIP, and our knowledge regarding the clinicopathological findings is rapidly expanding. At present, however, our knowledge of the clinicopathological findings of type 2 AIP, also called idiopathic duct centric chronic pancreatitis, is limited. Infiltration of neutrophils, but not IgG4-expressing plasmacytes, is a pathological hallmark of type 2 AIP (5, 6). In addition, the co-occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases is sometimes seen in patients with type 2 AIP. These differences in clinicopathological features between type 1 and type 2 AIP support the idea that two different types of immune responses are involved in the development of AIP, although both diseases are sensitive to corticosteroid treatment. Chronic inflammatory responses play an indispensable role in the development of inflammation-associated cancer, including Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-associated gastric cancer, hepatitis virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma, and colitis-associated colon cancer (7). The high risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) suggests the involvement of chronic inflammatory responses. (8, 9). Given that AIP is a unique form of chronic fibroinflammatory disorder of the pancreas, it is possible that AIP is a pre-cancerous condition. Indeed, recent studies have addressed the relationship between AIP and malignant diseases (10-14). Interestingly, it has been suggested that the presence of AIP is associated with cancers of other organs rather than the pancreas. In this review, we discuss the risk of cancer in type 1 AIP and IgG4-RD. ;IgG4-related disease|autoimmune pancreatitis|cancer.
5;Cancer and cure: A critical analysis;"Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases of the 20th century and spreading further with continuance and increasing incidence in the 21st century. The situation is so alarming that every fourth person is having a lifetime risk of cancer. India registers more than 11 lakh new cases of cancer every year, whereas, this figure is above 14 million worldwide. Is cancer curable? The short answer to this question is ""Yes."" In fact, all cancers are curable if they are caught early enough. Cancer cells continue to grow unless one of four things occur: (1) The cancerous mass is removed surgically, (2) using chemotherapy or another type of cancer-specific medication, such as hormonal therapy, (3) using radiation therapy, or (4) the cancer cells shrink and disappear on their own. A hundred years ago, cancer was not so common; however, since the last couple of decades, its incidence has been rising alarmingly, probably due to our changing lifestyle, habits, and increased life expectancy. Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases of the 20th century and spreading further with continuance and increasing incidence in the 21st century. The situation is so alarming that every fourth person is having a lifetime risk of cancer.[1] India registers more than 11 lakh new cases of cancer every year, whereas, this figure is above 14 million worldwide. We are constantly exposed to a variety of cancer causing agents, known as carcinogens. What is cancer? Put simply; cancer is the abnormal growth of cells. Cancers arise from any organ or body structure and are composed of tiny cells that have lost the ability to stop growing. Occasionally, cancer may be detected “incidentally” by a laboratory test or radiological routine test or for an entirely different reason. In general, cancer must reach a size of 1 cm, or be comprised of 1 million cells, before it is detected. At this point, it may be referred to as a “'mass,” a “growth,” a “tumor,” a “nodule,” a “lump,” or a “lesion.” Exceptions to this general rule include cancers of the blood and bone marrow (leukemia's and lymphomas) – which frequently do not produce a “mass,” but will be evident on laboratory tests. Transformation of a normal cell into a cancerous cell is probably not such a critical event in the genesis of cancer; rather it is the inability of immune cells of the body to identify and destroy the newly formed cancer cells when they are a few in numbers.[2] The risk of cancer is multiplied in those persons, whose immune system is suppressed due to any factor including chronic stress, old age, chronic debilitating disease, previous use of chemotherapy, and abuse of drugs such as analgesics, antibiotics, and corticosteroids.";cancer|cure.
6;Tumor microenvironment: recent advances in various cancer treatments;This is a review regarding different types of cancer treatments. We aimed at analyzing the tumor microenvironment and the recent trends for the therapeutic applications and effectiveness for several kinds of cancers. Traditionally the cancer treatment was based on the neoplastic cells. Methods such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, which were targeted on the highly proliferating mutated tumor cells, have been investigated. The tumor microenvironment describes the non-cancerous cells in the tumor and has enabled to investigate the behavior and response of the cancer cells to a treatment process it consists in a tissue that may have a predictive significance for tumor behavior and response to therapy. These include fibroblasts, immune cells and cells that comprise the blood vessels. It also includes the proteins produced by all of the cells present in the tumor that support the growth of the cancer cells. By monitoring changes in the tumor microenvironment using its molecular and cellular profiles as the tumor progresses will be vital for identifying cell or protein targets for the cancer prevention and its therapeutic purposes.;tumor|cancer.
7;Cancer-associated fibroblasts in tumor microenvironment - Accomplices in tumor malignancy;There is much cellular heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment. The tumor epithelia and stromal cells co-evolve, and this reciprocal relationship dictates almost every step of cancer development and progression. Despite this, many anticancer therapies are designed around druggable features of tumor epithelia, ignoring the supportive role of stromal cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the dominant cell type within the reactive stroma of many tumor types. Numerous previous studies have highlighted a pro-tumorigenic role for CAFs via secretion of various growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and the degradation of extracellular matrix. Recent works showed that CAFs secrete H2O2 to effect stromal-mediated field cancerization, transform primary epithelial cells, and aggravate cancer cell aggressiveness, in addition to inflammatory and mitogenic factors. Molecular characterization of CAFs also underscores the importance of Notch and specific nuclear receptor signaling in the activation of CAFs. This review consolidates recent findings of CAFs and highlights areas for future investigations.;Cancer-associated fibroblasts|Field cancerization|Metastasis|Somatic Mutation Theory|Tissue Organization Field Theory|Tumor microenvironment
8;Measuring cancer evolution from the genome;The temporal dynamics of cancer evolution remain elusive, because it is impractical to longitudinally observe cancers unperturbed by treatment. Consequently, our knowledge of how cancers grow largely derives from inferences made from a single point in time - the endpoint in the cancer's evolution, when it is removed from the body and studied in the laboratory. Fortuitously however, the cancer genome, by virtue of ongoing mutations that uniquely mark clonal lineages within the tumour, provides a rich, yet surreptitious, record of cancer development. In this review, we describe how a cancer's genome can be analysed to reveal the temporal history of mutation and selection, and discuss why both selective and neutral evolution feature prominently in carcinogenesis. We argue that selection in cancer can only be properly studied once we have some understanding of what the absence of selection looks like. We review the data describing punctuated evolution in cancer, and reason that punctuated phenotype evolution is consistent with both gradual and punctuated genome evolution. We conclude that, to map and predict evolutionary trajectories during carcinogenesis, it is critical to better understand the relationship between genotype change and phenotype change.;clonal evolution of cancer| gradualism| hopeful monsters| intratumour heterogeneity| neutral evolution| next-generation sequencing| punctuated equilibrium| saltation| selection| subclones.
9;Clinical, Prognostic and Therapeutic Significance of Heat Shock Proteins in Cancer;Background: Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) constitute a group of proteins that play a crucial role in the process of protein folding. HSPs are also known to modulate a number of key apoptotic factors. High expression of these proteins is reported in an array of cancers, such as breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, ovarian, gastric, oral and esophageal cancer. Ample amount of investigations were carried out on a variety of cancers suggesting HSPs as a promising hallmark in cancers. Their expression profile in several tumors elucidates that they help in proliferation, invasion, metastasis and death of cancerous cells. Detection of the levels of heat shock proteins and their specific antibodies in the sera of diseased individuals can play an important role in cancer diagnosis. Objectives: This review will present and summarize latest research being carried out on heat shock proteins. It will also highlight the clinical and prognostic features of HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90 and HSP110, and will discuss future implications of HSPs in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Furthermore, the role of heat shock proteins as a therapeutic target in cancer will be discussed. In addition, the review article will report various studies, where HSPs have been targeted for their therapeutic potential. Conclusion: In summary, multiple experimental investigations have been successful in suggesting the role of heat shock protein as a clinical biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer. HSPs are associated with a number of cancer hallmarks such as cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Inhibition of HSPs has resulted in successful therapeutic outcome in cancer. It has served as a novel anti-cancer therapy for the treatment of several cancer forms. However, more experimental studies are required to elucidate the reliability and efficacy of heat shock proteins in combination with other conventional markers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Novel and effective interventions through HSP inhibition are expected to decrease the burden of cancer in the near future.;Heat shock proteins| apoptotic| cancer| cell proliferation| prognosis| therapeutics.
10;What Is Cancer?;This essay focuses on themes in Explaining Cancer: Finding Order in Disorder (2018) by Anya Plutynski, a monograph that has important things to say about both the peculiarities of cancers and our theories about them. Cancer's agents of destruction are human cells that have been recruited and to some extent transformed into pathological organisms or the building blocks of tumors. Cancers both undermine and exploit mechanisms of multicellular organization, and understanding them gives rise to difficult philosophical problems. In addition to sketching Plutynski's discussion of these problems, this essay defends Christopher Boorse's account of disease from Plutynski's criticisms, and it expresses some qualms about her treatment of scientific explanation.;cancer.
11;Cancer prevention: from 1727 to milestones of the past 100 years;The rich, multidisciplinary history of cancer prevention recounted here begins with surgical and workplace recommendations of the 1700s and ends with 2009 results of the enormous (35,535 men) Selenium and Vitamin E [prostate] Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT). This history comprises a fascinating array of chemopreventive, vaccine, surgical, and behavioral science research, both preclinical and clinical. Preclinical milestones of cancer prevention include the 1913 and 1916 mouse studies by Lathrop and Loeb of cancer development associated with pregnancy or cancer prevention through castration (oophorectomy), preventing chemically induced mouse carcinogenesis as early as 1929, energy restriction studies in the 1940s, the 1950s discoveries and later molecular characterizations of field cancerization and multistep carcinogenesis, and the effects of angiogenesis inhibition in genetically engineered mice reported in 2009. The extraordinary panoply of clinical research includes numerous large and smaller chemopreven ion studies of nutritional supplements, other dietary approaches, a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin trial in 1976, molecular-targeted agents, and agents to prevent infection-related cancers such as hepatitis B virus vaccine to prevent liver cancer in 1984. Clinical surgical prevention includes removal of intraepithelial neoplasia detected by screening (including Pap testing developed in 1929 and culposcopy for cervical premalignancy and colonoscopy and polypectomy to prevent colorectal cancer begun in the 1960s) and prophylactic surgeries, such as in Lynch syndrome patients begun in 1977. Behavioral studies include smoking cessation and control beginning in the 1950s, obesity control rooted in studies of 1841, and genetic-counseling and cancer-survivorship studies. This history of pioneering events may help in better understanding who we are and what we want to achieve as cancer prevention researchers and practitioners.;cancer.
12;Detection of Cancer DNA in Early Stage and Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients;Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer-related death. There are many subtypes of breast cancer, which can be identified through the process of molecular and genetic profiling. While the current standard of care utilizes tumor tissue biopsy to subclassify breast cancer, plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) can be detected through droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) of plasma obtained from a simple blood draw. Tissue biopsy is not only more invasive but because tumors exhibit heterogeneity it can be less accurate. Blood collects DNA shed from normal and cancerous cells alike, thus ddPCR of plasma offers a broader picture of a cancer's genetic makeup. This chapter summarizes how patients with breast cancer can be screened for specific cancerous mutations in both tissue and plasma through the use of ddPCR. Every year, over 230,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and nearly 40,000 die from the disease. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancerrelated death [1, 2]. Typically, breast cancer is detected via mammography and confirmed through tissue sampling. From here, patients undergo specific therapies targeted toward their class of breast cancer, which is defined principally by the presence or absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). Researchers have shown that within these subgroups, there are specific, idiosyncratic mutations, which can be useful for assessing burden of disease, predicting response to therapy, and monitoring the latter in a rapid and minimally invasive approach. These include mutations in PIK3CA, ESR1, TP53, MAP3K1, GATA3, RPTOR, ERBB2, and ERBB3 [3–6]. Current studies of receptor mutations, however, face a significant barrier: they rely on single site biopsy of tumor tissue. This method is problematic because tumors have been shown to exhibit heterogeneity, so sampling a single piece of tissue may miss sites of the specific mutations listed above. This same heterogeneity can exist within metastatic tumors, and furthermore, there has been documented heterogeneity between metastases at different sites of the body, even if the metastases originated from the same primary tumor [7, 8]. In other words, tissue biopsy limits clinicians from seeing the whole genetic picture. In order to circumvent this challenge, researchers can now use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) on samples of plasma to screen for these same mutations, through a procedure colloquially termed “liquid biopsy.” The body’s blood supply feeds primary tumors as well as metastases, and preliminary research suggests there is no selectivity in terms of which tumor cells’ DNA is deposited into the blood. In fact, normal and cancerous cells deposit into circulation, which makes the bloodstream an effective repository of cellular DNA, cancer and otherwise [9–11]. Thus, circulating blood contains traces of all variations of tumor DNA, which makes plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA) most representative of the varied genetic makeup of cancer cells. Sampling peripheral blood is also much easier than tissue biopsy, and the procedure comes with far fewer risks. There are many burgeoning applications of ddPCR within oncology, and breast cancer is poised to greatly benefit from the approach. The efficacy of ptDNA/ddPCR for detecting PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer has already been demonstrated with 93.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity in a study of 29 patients with early stage breast cancer [12]. It is important to clarify that this approach is specific for plasma, not serum. Research has shown the latter to not be reliable, whereas plasma has reproducible data supporting its efficacy [13, 14]. From identifying specific mutations sensitive to targeted therapy, to monitoring response to treatment, to detecting residual disease, this highly sensitive, cost effective approach offers improvement of breast cancer treatment and forward progress in studying the science behind it.

13;Early epigenetic cancer decisions;Abstract A cancer dogma states that inactivation of oncogene(s) can cause cancer remission, implying that oncogenes are the Achilles' heel of cancers. This current model of cancer has kept oncogenes firmly in focus as therapeutic targets and is in agreement with the fact that in human cancers all cancerous cells, with independence of the cellular heterogeneity existing within the tumour, carry the same oncogenic genetic lesions. However, recent studies of the interactions between an oncogene and its target cell have shown that oncogenes contribute to cancer development via developmental reprogramming of the epigenome within the target cell. These results provide the first evidence that carcinogenesis can be initiated by epigenetic stem cell reprogramming, and uncover a new role for oncogenes in the origin of cancer. Here we analyse these evidences and discuss how this vision offers new avenues for developing novel anti-cancer interventions. Since the discovery that human cancers contain activated oncogenes, many efforts have been made to elucidate the causal role that these oncogenes play in cancer development. These previous works have shown that oncogene expression is not only required for initiation of cancer but also for the maintenance of the disease and have kept oncogenes firmly in focus as therapeutic targets. In mouse models where oncogene expression is driven by tissue-specific promoters, tumours arise at high frequencies, but disappear again when the inducing stimulus is switched off;cancer|tumor.
14;Mapping cancer origins;Cancer comprises a bewildering assortment of diseases that kill 7.5 million people each year. Poor understanding of cancer's diversity currently thwarts our goal of a cure for every patient, but recent integration of genomic and stem cell technologies promises a route through this impasse. Seventy years since the first reported use of cancer chemotherapy, malignancies are the second most common cause of death among children and adults. Why are the headlines rarely punctuated with cancer success stories? One explanation is that while classifying cancers is relatively straightforward, understanding the basis of cancer heterogeneity is complex. Over the years we have become quite proficient at cataloging cancer according to patterns of epidemiology and pathology. Each cancer is recognized to occur at a particular age, more frequently in one sex than another, and have a particular morphology—usually resembling the originating tissue. Advances in imaging and histology have enabled us to further segregate cancer diagnoses into distinct stages and grades that predict different treatment responses and prognoses. Despite this exhaustive work, our attempts to understand the processes that generate the different forms of cancer have proved far less fruitful, hamstringing efforts to advance therapy in the clinic. Failure to determine the biological basis of histologically similar but clinically and molecularly distinct cancers (inter-tumoral heterogeneity) has proved especially limiting: preventing the development of preclinical models of the full spectrum of human cancers, and fostering a clinical trials culture that accepts ‘all comers’ with only the broadest categories of histological criteria to filter eligibility. Our failure to define the origins of cancer subtypes is not for want of trying. However, our relatively crude understanding what drives cancers, coupled with uncertainty about initiating cell types has prevented investigators from making the jump from correlative observation to functional understanding. Recently, a string of publications suggest that the genomic revolution may provide a route through this impasse. Microarray technologies have transformed the depth with which we Our failure to define the origins of cancer subtypes is not for want of trying. However, our relatively crude understanding what drives cancers, coupled with uncertainty about initiating cell types has prevented investigators from making the jump from correlative observation to functional understanding. Recently, a string of publications suggest that the genomic revolution may provide a route through this impasse. Microarray technologies have transformed the depth with which we can interrogate cancers like leukemias (Ross et al., 2004), breast cancers (Sotiriou et al., 2003) and brain tumors (Gibson et al., 2010;cancer
15;Field cancerization in breast cancer;Breast cancer affects one in seven women worldwide during their lifetime. Widespread mammographic screening programs and education campaigns allow for early detection of the disease, often during its asymptomatic phase. Current practice in treatment and recurrence monitoring is based primarily on pathological evaluations but can also encompass genomic evaluations, both of which focus on the primary tumor. Although breast cancer is one of the most studied cancers, patients still recur at a rate of up to 15% within the first 10 years post-surgery. Local recurrence was originally attributed to tumor cells contaminating histologically normal (HN) tissues beyond the surgical margin, but advances in technology have allowed for the identification of distinct aberrations that exist in the peri-tumoral tissues themselves. One leading theory to explain this phenomenon is the field cancerization theory. Under this hypothesis, tumors arise from a field of molecularly altered cells that create a permissive environment for malignant evolution, which can occur with or without morphological changes. The traditional histopathology paradigm dictates that molecular alterations are reflected in the tissue phenotype. However, the spectrum of inter-patient variability of normal breast tissue may obfuscate recognition of a cancerized field during routine diagnostics. In this review, we explore the concept of field cancerization focusing on HN peri-tumoral tissues: we present the pathological and molecular features of field cancerization within these tissues and discuss how the use of peri-tumoral tissues can affect research. Our observations suggest that pathological and molecular evaluations could be used synergistically to assess risk and guide the therapeutic management of patients.;cancer|breast cancer| cancer-adjacent tissues| field cancerization| histologically normal.
16;Signaling, metabolism, and cancer: An important relationship for therapeutic intervention;In cancerous cells, significant changes occur in the activity of signaling pathways affecting a wide range of cellular activities ranging from growth and proliferation to apoptosis, invasiveness, and metastasis. Extensive changes also happen with respect to the metabolism of a cancerous cell encompassing a wide range of functions that include: nutrient acquisition, biosynthesis of macromolecules, and energy generation. These changes are important and some therapeutic approaches for treating cancers have focused on targeting the metabolism of cancerous cells. Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes have a significant effect on the metabolism of cells. There appears to be a close interaction between metabolism and the signaling pathways in a cancerous cell, in which the interaction provides the metabolic needs of a cancerous cell for uncontrolled proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and metastasis. In this review, we have reviewed the latest findings in this regard and briefly review the most recent research findings regarding targeting the metabolism of cancer cells as a therapeutic approach for treatment of cancer.;cancer| cancer treatment| metabolism| signaling pathways.
17;Sex differences in cancer risk and outcomes after kidney transplantation;Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) experience a two- to four-fold increased risk of developing and dying from cancer compared with the general population. High cancer risk results from the interaction of both modifiable and non-modifiable factors. This mapping review explores the impact of sex disparity on cancer's increased incidence and mortality after kidney transplantation (KT). In terms of age, population-based studies indicate that younger recipients of both sexes experience a higher risk of cancer, but this is more pronounced in young women. On the contrary, older men are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer, although their increased risk is not statistically significant compared with the general population. Regarding cancer type, studies show an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma, gynecologic and lung cancer in women, and bladder and kidney cancer in men. Immune-related cancers such as pos-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders and melanoma are increased in both sexes. Mortality also shows differences between sexes. Although cancer is the second cause of death in both male and female KTRs, studies show higher overall mortality in men and elderly recipients. However, the relative risk of cancer mortality compared with the general population is higher at a younger age, with disparate results regarding sex. Female KTRs appear to die at a younger age than males when compared with the general population. Differences in cancer rates by sex after renal transplantation need further studies. A better understanding of sex-specific differences in cancer epidemiology after KT could help nephrologists to better address pre-transplant counseling, to establish early surveillance programs, and to plan modifiable risk factors such as immunosuppression.;Cancer| Gender| Kidney transplantation| Risk factor| Sex.
18;Cancer--an ayurvedic perspective;An integrated approach is needed to manage cancer using the growing body of knowledge gained through scientific developments. Thousands of herbal and traditional compounds are being screened worldwide to validate their use as anti-cancerous drugs. The science of Ayurveda is supposed to add a step on to the curative aspects of cancers that have resemblance with clinical entities of arbuda and granthi mentioned in Sushrutha samhita. Hence, an attempt is made in this review to discuss about the pathology and therapeutic management of various cancers described in Ayurveda. Review of literature on anticancer drugs of plant origin revealed identification of newer ayurvedic drugs that are not mentioned in the ancient texts. These new findings add up to ayurvedic science that has been developed through ages. In addition, details of experimental and clinical studies conducted on single and compound ayurvedic preparations for their anticancer efficacy strongly emphasize ayurvedic therapy as a scientifically driven one and not simply unconventional.;cancer.
19;Pathophysiology of lung cancer;Cigarette smoking is responsible for approximately 30% of all cancer deaths. Smoking accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases in men and 75% in women. There are about 38 million former cigarette smokers and about 50 million smokers in the United States today. Smoking rates are higher among blacks, blue collar workers, and less educated people. More than 140,000 lives will be lost to cancer each year because of tobacco smoking. All cancers caused by cigarette smoking could be prevented. It is hoped that public education, smoking cessation programs, and efforts to eliminate carcinogens in the work environment will impact the future incidence of new lung cancer cases. As preventive measures continue, refinement in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer must continue to advance. The recognition of any one of cancer's seven warning signals and prompt subsequent action could lead to earlier detection and a chance for 3- and 5-year survival rates to improve. With medical and research progress, clinical concerns have grown beyond addressing only the patient's physical needs to include important issues such as employment and insurance needs and the psychosocial needs of both the patient and the family as they learn to live with cancer.;cancer|lung cancer.
20;The Role of Telomerase in Breast Cancer's Response to Therapy;Currently, breast cancer appears to be the most widespread cancer in the world and the most common cause of cancer deaths. This specific type of cancer affects women in both developed and developing countries. Prevention and early diagnosis are very important factors for good prognosis. A characteristic feature of cancer cells is the ability of unlimited cell division, which makes them immortal. Telomeres, which are shortened with each cell division in normal cells, are rebuilt in cancer cells by the enzyme telomerase, which is expressed in more than 85% of cancers (up to 100% of adenocarcinomas, including breast cancer). Telomerase may have different functions that are related to telomeres or unrelated. It has been shown that high activity of the enzyme in cancer cells is associated with poor cell sensitivity to therapies. Therefore, telomerase has become a potential target for cancer therapies. The low efficacy of therapies has resulted in the search for new combined and more effective therapeutic methods, including the involvement of telomerase inhibitors and telomerase-targeted immunotherapy.;breast cancer|resistance|telomerase|therapy|cancer.
21;Bladder cancer extracellular vesicles drive tumorigenesis by inducing the unfolded protein response in endoplasmic reticulum of nonmalignant cells;The field cancerization effect has been proposed to explain bladder cancer's multifocal and recurrent nature, yet the mechanisms of this effect remain unknown. In this work, using cell biology, flow cytometry, and qPCR analyses, along with a xenograft mouse tumor model, we show that chronic exposure to tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) results in the neoplastic transformation of nonmalignant human SV-HUC urothelial cells. Inhibition of EV uptake prevented this transformation. Transformed cells not only possessed several oncogenic properties, such as increased genome instability, loss of cell-cell contact inhibition, and invasiveness, but also displayed altered morphology and cell structures, such as an enlarged cytoplasm with disrupted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) alignment and the accumulation of smaller mitochondria. Exposure of SV-HUC cells to TEVs provoked the unfolded protein response in the endoplasmic reticulum (UPRER). Prolonged induction of UPRER signaling activated the survival branch of the UPRER pathway, in which cells had elevated expression of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), NF-κB, and the inflammatory cytokine leptin, and incurred loss of the pro-apoptotic protein C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). More importantly, inhibition of ER stress by docosahexaenoic acid prevented TEV-induced transformation. We propose that TEVs promote malignant transformation of predisposed cells by inhibiting pro-apoptotic signals and activating tumor-promoting ER stress-induced unfolded protein response and inflammation. This study provides detailed insight into the mechanisms underlying the bladder cancer field effect and tumor recurrence.; bladder cancer| cell stress| cytokine| endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress)| exosome (vesicle)|extracellular vesicles|filed cancerization|inflammation|unfolded protein response (UPR)| urothelial carcinoma|cancer.

23;Pathological sequelae of long-haul COVID;The world continues to contend with successive waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fueled by the emergence of viral variants. At the same time, persistent, prolonged and often debilitating sequelae are increasingly recognized in convalescent individuals, named 'post-COVID-19 syndrome' or 'long-haul COVID'. Clinical symptomatology includes fatigue, malaise, dyspnea, defects in memory and concentration and a variety of neuropsychiatric syndromes as the major manifestations, and several organ systems can be involved. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood at present. This Review details organ-specific sequelae of post-COVID-19 syndromes and examines the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms available so far, elaborating on persistent inflammation, induced autoimmunity and putative viral reservoirs. Finally, we propose diagnostic strategies to better understand this heterogeneous disorder that continues to afflict millions of people worldwide.;covid|covid-19.
24;COVID-19: Virology, biology and novel laboratory diagnosis;Background: At the end of December 2019, a novel coronavirus tentatively named SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, a central city in China, was announced by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has become a major public health concern after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively. As of 29 October 2020, the total number of COVID-19 cases had reached over 44 million worldwide, with more than 1.17 million confirmed deaths. Discussion: SARS-CoV-2 infected patients usually present with severe viral pneumonia. Similar to SARS-CoV, the virus enters respiratory tract cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2. The structural proteins play an essential role in budding the virus particles released from different host cells. To date, an approved vaccine or treatment option of a preventive character to avoid severe courses of COVID-19 is still not available. Conclusions: In the present study, we provide a brief review of the general biological features of CoVs and explain the pathogenesis, clinical symptoms and diagnostic approaches regarding monitoring future infectivity and prevent emerging COVID-19 infections.;coronavirus|diagnostic methods|genome structure|pathogenesis.
25;Treatment for COVID-19: An overview;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome, a characteristic hyperinflammatory response, vascular damage, microangiopathy, angiogenesis and widespread thrombosis. Four stages of COVID-19 have been identified: the first stage is characterised by upper respiratory tract infection the second by the onset of dyspnoea and pneumonia the third by a worsening clinical scenario dominated by a cytokine storm and the consequent hyperinflammatory state and the fourth by death or recovery. Currently, no treatment can act specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the pathological features and different clinical phases of COVID-19, particularly in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the classes of drugs used are antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors/antirheumatic drugs, low molecular weight heparins, plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. During this eme gency period of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical researchers are using and testing a variety of possible treatments. Based on these premises, this review aims to discuss the most updated pharmacological treatments to effectively act against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and support researchers and clinicians in relation to any current and future developments in curing COVID-19 patients.;Antirheumatic drugs| Antiviral agents| COVID-19| Inflammation inhibitors| Low molecular weight heparins| SARS-CoV-2.
26;A Comprehensive Review of COVID-19 Virology, Vaccines, Variants, and Therapeutics;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused more than 179 million infections and 3.8 million deaths worldwide. Throughout the past year, multiple vaccines have already been developed and used, while some others are in the process of being developed. However, the emergence of new mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 that have demonstrated immune-evading characteristics and an increase in infective capabilities leads to potential ineffectiveness of the vaccines against these variants. The purpose of this review article is to highlight the current understanding of the immunological mechanisms of the virus and vaccines, as well as to investigate some key variants and mutations of the virus driving the current pandemic and their impacts on current management guidelines. We also discussed new technologies being developed for the prevention, treatment, and detection of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we thoroughly reviewed and provided crucial information on SARS-CoV-2 virology, vaccines and drugs being used and developed for its prevention and treatment, as well as important variant strains. Our review paper will be beneficial to health care professionals and researchers so they can have a better understanding of the basic sciences, prevention, and clinical treatment of COVID-19 during the pandemic.; antiviral therapy|coronavirus disease 2019| severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2| vaccines| variant strains.
27;COVID-19 pandemic: from origins to outcomes. A comprehensive review of viral pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, and management;Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen for the COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and by March 2020, it was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has overburdened healthcare systems in most countries and has led to massive economic losses. SARS-CoV-2 transmission typically occurs by respiratory droplets. The average incubation period is 6.4 days and presenting symptoms typically include fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue. While the majority of patients tend to have a mild illness, a minority of patients develop severe hypoxia requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Management is mostly supportive. However, several direct anti-viral agents, and immunomodulatory therapy with steroids and various cytokine blockers seem promising in early results. However, an effective vaccine has been established, which will help curb the pandemic.;Covid - 19|coronavirus
28;Laboratory testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19;Rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection is one of the cornerstones of pandemic control. With the myriad of tests available in the market, the use of correct specimen type and laboratory-testing technique in the right clinical scenario could be challenging for non-specialists. In this mini-review, we will discuss the difference in diagnostic performance for different upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, and the role of blood and fecal specimens. We will analyze the performance characteristics of laboratory testing techniques of nucleic acid amplification tests, antigen detection tests, antibody detection tests, and point-of-care tests. Finally, the dynamics of viral replication and antibody production, and laboratory results interpretation in conjunction with clinical scenarios will be discussed.;COVID-19| Coronavirus| Diagnosis| SARS-CoV-2

30;Supplementation with vitamin D in the COVID-19 pandemic?;The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has high transmissibility and could result in acute lung injury in a fraction of patients. By counterbalancing the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is the fusion receptor of the virus, plays a protective role against the development of complications of this viral infection. Vitamin D can induce the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and regulate the immune system through different mechanisms. Epidemiologic studies of the relationship between vitamin D and various respiratory infections were reviewed and, here, the postulated mechanisms and clinical data supporting the protective role of vitamin D against COVID-19-mediated complications are discussed.; COVID-19|SARS-CoV-2|vitamin D.

40;Machine Learning: Algorithms, Real-World Applications and Research Directions;In the current age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), the digital world has a wealth of data, such as Internet of Things (IoT) data, cybersecurity data, mobile data, business data, social media data, health data, etc. To intelligently analyze these data and develop the corresponding smart and automated applications, the knowledge of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly, machine learning (ML) is the key. Various types of machine learning algorithms such as supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning exist in the area. Besides, the deep learning, which is part of a broader family of machine learning methods, can intelligently analyze the data on a large scale. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on these machine learning algorithms that can be applied to enhance the intelligence and the capabilities of an application.

41;A Combinational Perspective in Stimulating Cooperation in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks;In wireless ad hoc networks cooperation among nodes cannot always be assumed since nodes with limited resources and different owners are capable of making independent decisions. Cooperation problems in topology control and packet forwarding tasks have been mostly studied separately but these two tasks are not independent. Considering a joint cooperation problem by taking into account dependencies between tasks will result in more reliable and efficient networks. In this paper topology control definition is extended to cover cooperation problem in both packet forwarding and topology control in a single problem. In this definition nodes have to adjust their transmission power and decide on their relay role. This paper models the interactions of nodes as a potential game with two-dimensional utility function. The presented model, named TCFORCE (Topology Control packet FORwarding Cooperation Enforcement), preserves the network connectivity and reduces the energy consumption by providing cooperative paths between all pairs of nodes in the network.;
42;A Fine-Grained Runtime PowerPerformance Optimization Method for Processors with Adaptive Pipeline Depth;Recently, a method known as pipeline stage unification (PSU) has been proposed to alleviate the increasing energy consumption problem in modern microprocessors. PSU achieves a high energy efficiency by employing a changeable pipeline depth and its working scheme is eligible for a fine control method. In this paper, we propose a dynamic method to study fine-grained program interval behaviors based on some easy-to-get runtime processor metrics. Using this method to determine the proper PSU configurations during the program execution, we are able to achieve an averaged 13.5% energydelay-product (EDP) reduction for SPEC CPU2000 integer benchmarks, compared to the baseline processor. This value is only 0.14% larger than the theoretically idealized controlling. Our hardware synthesis result indicates that the proposed method can largely decrease the hardware overhead in both area and delay costs, as compared to a previous program study method which is based on working set signatures.;
43;A Functional LIL for m-Fold Integrated Brownian Motion∗∗∗;Let {Xm(t), t ∈ R+} be an m-Fold integrated Brownian motion. In this paper, with the help of small ball probability estimate, a functional law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) for Xm(t) is established. This extends the classic Chung type liminf result for this process. Furthermore, a result about the weighted occupation measure for Xm(t) is also obtained.;
44;A Hybrid of Theorems of Goldbach and Piatetski-Shapiro∗∗∗;It is proved that for almost all sufficiently large even integers n, the prime variable equation n = p1 + p2, p1 ∈ Pγ is solvable, with 13/15 < γ ≤ 1, where Pγ = {p | p = [m 1 γ ], for integer m and prime p} is the set of the Piatetski-Shapiro primes.;
45;A Lower Bound on Unknotting Number∗∗∗;In this paper the authors use a modified Wirtinger presentation to give a lower bound on the unknotting number of a knot in S3..;
46;Activity Recognition Based on RFID Object Usage for Smart Mobile;Activity recognition is a core aspect of ubiquitous computing applications. In order to deploy activity recognition systems in the real world, we need simple sensing systems with lightweight computational modules to accurately analyze sensed data. In this paper, we propose a simple method to recognize human activities using simple object information involved in activities. We apply activity theory for representing complex human activities and propose a penalized naive Bayes classifier for performing activity recognition. Our results show that our method reduces computation up to an order of magnitude in both learning and inference without penalizing accuracy, when compared to hidden Markov models and conditional random fields.;
47;Asymptotic Normality of LS Estimate in Simple Linear EV Regression Model;Though EV model is theoretically more appropriate for applications in which measurement errors exist, people are still more inclined to use the ordinary regression models and the traditional LS method owing to the difficulties of statistical inference and computation. So it is meaningful to study the performance of LS estimate in EV model. In this article we obtain general conditions guaranteeing the asymptotic normality of the estimates of regression coefficients in the linear EV model. It is noticeable that the result is in some way different from the corresponding result in the ordinary regression model.;
48;Beckner Inequality on Finite- and Infinite-Dimensional Manifolds∗∗; By using the dimension-free Harnack inequality, the coupling method, and Bakry-Emery’s argument, some explicit lower bounds are presented for the constant of the Beckner type inequality on compact manifolds. As applications, the Beckner inequality and the transportation cost inequality are established for a class of continuous spin systems. In particular, some results in [1, 2] are generalized.;
49;Case Study Evidence for an Irreducible Form of Knowing How to An Argument Against a Reductive Epistemology;Over recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in arguments favouring intellectualism—the view that Ryle’s epistemic distinction is invalid because knowing how is in fact nothing but a species of knowing that. The aim of this paper is to challenge intellectualism by introducing empirical evidence supporting a form of knowing how that resists such a reduction. In presenting a form of visuomotor pathology known as visual agnosia, I argue that certain actions performed by patient DF can be distinguished from a mere physical ability because they are (1) intentional and (2) knowledge-based yet these actions fail to satisfy the criteria for propositional knowledge. It is therefore my contention that there exists a form of intentional action that not only constitutes a genuine claim to knowledge but, in being irreducible to knowing that, resists the intellectualist argument for exhaustive epistemic reduction.;
50;Censure Theory Still Best Accounts for Punishment of the Guilty Reply to Montague;In an article previously published in this journal, Phillip Montague critically surveys and rejects a handful of contemporary attempts to explain why state punishment is morally justified. Among those targeted is one of my defences of the censure theory of punishment, according to which state punishment is justified because the political community has a duty to express disapproval of those guilty of injustice. My defence of censure theory supposes, per argumentum, that there is always some defeasible moral reason for the state to proportionately punish the guilty, and then demonstrates that censure theory best entails and explains this intuition. Montague does not question the intuition, but instead argues that three rival theories of punishment, including his societal-defence view, account for it to no worse a degree than my censure theory. In this article I defend my initial argument, noting resources for its defence that Montague does not appreciate and that, I maintain, provide those who believe that there is always pro tanto injustice in the state failing to proportionately punish the guilty reason to adopt censure theory over all competitors, including Montague’s societal-defence theory.;
51;Comments on Michael Jacovides “How Berkeley Corrupted His Capacity to Conceive”;The manuscript includes comments on Michael Jacovides’s paper, “How Berkeley Corrupted His Capacity to Conceive.” The paper and comments were delivered at the conference “Meaning and Modern Empiricism” held at Virginia Tech in April 2008. I consider Jacovides’s treatment of Berkeley’s Resemblance Argument and his interpretation of the Master Argument. In particular, I distinguish several ways of understanding the disagreement between Jacovides and Kenneth Winkler over the right way to read the Master Argument.;
52;Commonsense Realism and Triangulation;Realism about the external world enjoys little philosophical support these days. I rectify this predicament by taking a relatively pragmatist line of thought to defend commonsense realism I support commonsense realism through an interpretation and application of Donald Davidson’s notion of triangulation, the triangle composed of two communicators coordinating and correcting their responses with a shared causal stimulus. This argument is important because it has a crucial advantage over the often used abductive argument for realism. My argument avoids unwarranted conclusions, whereas the abductive argument is “inflationary” because it reaches beyond the limits of evidence for its realist conclusion. To illustrate the problems of the abductive argument and motivate my Davidsonian approach, I take a brief look at the abductive argument for realism in Frederick Will’s work.;
53;Consciousness and Modal Empiricism;David Chalmers supports his contention that there is a possible world populated by our zombie twins by arguing for the assumption that conceivability entails possibility. But, I argue, the modal epistemology he sets forth, ‘modal rationalism,’ ignores the problem of incompleteness and relies on an idealized notion of conceivability. As a consequence, this epistemology can’t justify our quotidian judgments of possibility, let alone those judgments that concern the mind/body connection. Working from the analogy that the imagination is to the possible as perception is to the actual, I set forth a competing epistemology, ‘modal empiricism.’ This epistemology survives the incompleteness objection and allows some of our everyday modal judgments to be justified. But this epistemology can’t justify the claim that Zombie World is possible, which leaves Chalmers’s property dualism without the support it needs.;
54;Construction of 1-Resilient Boolean Functions with Optimal Algebraic Immunity and Good Nonlinearity;This paper presents a construction for a class of 1-resilient functions with optimal algebraic immunity on an even number of variables. The construction is based on the concatenation of two balanced functions in associative classes. For some n, a part of 1-resilient functions with maximum algebraic immunity constructed in the paper can achieve almost optimal nonlinearity. Apart from their high nonlinearity, the functions reach Siegenthaler’s upper bound of algebraic degree. Also a class of 1-resilient functions on any number n > 2 of variables with at least sub-optimal algebraic immunity is provided.;
55;Design for Testability Features of Godson-3 Multicore Microprocessor;This paper describes the design for testability (DFT) challenges and techniques of Godson-3 microprocessor, which is a scalable multicore processor based on the scalable mesh of crossbar (SMOC) on-chip network and targets high-end applications. Advanced techniques are adopted to make the DFT design scalable and achieve low-power and low-cost test with limited IO resources. To achieve a scalable and flexible test access, a highly elaborate test access mechanism (TAM) is implemented to support multiple test instructions and test modes. Taking advantage of multiple identical cores embedding in the processor, scan partition and on-chip comparisons are employed to reduce test power and test time. Test compression technique is also utilized to decrease test time. To further reduce test power, clock controlling logics are designed with ability to turn off clocks of non-testing partitions. In addition, scan collars of CACHEs are designed to perform functional test with low-speed ATE for speed-binning purposes, which poses low complexity and has good correlation results.;
56;Energy Efficient Backoff Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms for Multi-Hop Wireless Sensor Networks;Compared with flat routing protocols, clustering is a fundamental performance improvement technique in wireless sensor networks, which can increase network scalability and lifetime. In this paper, we integrate the multi-hop technique with a backoff-based clustering algorithm to organize sensors. By using an adaptive backoff strategy, the algorithm not only realizes load balance among sensor node, but also achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. Simulation results also demonstrate our algorithm is more energy-efficient than classical ones. Our algorithm is also easily extended to generate a hierarchy of cluster heads to obtain better network management and energy-efficiency.;
57;Geometric Optics for One-Dimensional Schrodinger-Poisson System;Compared with flat routing protocols, clustering is a fundamental performance improvement technique in wireless sensor networks, which can increase network scalability and lifetime. In this paper, we integrate the multi-hop technique with a backoff-based clustering algorithm to organize sensors. By using an adaptive backoff strategy, the algorithm not only realizes load balance among sensor node, but also achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution across the network. Simulation results also demonstrate our algorithm is more energy-efficient than classical ones. Our algorithm is also easily extended to generate a hierarchy of cluster heads to obtain better network management and energy-efficiency. This paper considers a family of Schr¨odinger-Poisson system in one dimension, whose initial data oscillates so that a caustic appears. By using the Lagrangian integrals, the authors obtain a uniform description of the solution outside the caustic, and near the caustic.;
58;Maslov P -Index Theory for a Symplectic Path with Applications∗∗;The Maslov P-index theory for a symplectic path is defined. Various properties of this index theory such as homotopy invariant, symplectic additivity and the relations with other Morse indices are studied. As an application, the non-periodic problem for some asymptotically linear Hamiltonian systems is considered.;
59;Multi-Level Partition of Unity Algebraic Point Set Surfaces;We present a multi-level partition of unity algebraic set surfaces (MPU-APSS) for surface reconstruction which can be represented by either a projection or in an implicit form. An algebraic point set surface (APSS) defines a smooth surface from a set of unorganized points using local moving least-squares (MLS) fitting of algebraic spheres. However, due to the local nature, APSS does not work well for geometry editing and modeling. Instead, our method builds an implicit approximation function for the scattered point set based on the partition of unity approach. By using an octree subdivision strategy, we first adaptively construct local algebraic spheres for the point set, and then apply weighting functions to blend together these local shape functions. Finally, we compute an error-controlled approximation of the signed distance function from the surface. In addition, we present an efficient projection operator which makes our representation suitable for point set filtering and dynamic point resampling. We deonstrate the effectiveness of our unified approach for both surface reconstruction and geometry modeling such as surface completion.;
60;Negative Actionsp;Some philosophers have argued that refraining from performing an action consists in actively keeping oneself from performing that action or preventing one’s performing it. Since activities must be held to be positive actions, this implies that negative actions are a species of positive actions which is to say that all actions are positive actions. I defend the following claims: (i) Positive actions necessarily include activity or effort, negative actions may require activity or effort, but never include the activity or effort which may be required. (ii) Unless it is, or was, at some time in P’s power to Q, P does not refrain from Q-ing. (iii) Negative actions are actions, they are causings of negative facts.;
61;Normative Reasons and the Agent-NeutralRelative Dichotomy;The distinction between the agent-relative and the agent-neutral plays a prominent role in recent attempts to taxonomize normative theories. Its importance extends to most areas in practical philosophy, though. Despite its popularity, the distinction remains difficult to get a good grip on. In part this has to do with the fact that there is no consensus concerning the sort of objects to which we should apply the distinction. Thomas Nagel distinguishes between agent-neutral and agent-relative values, reasons, and principles Derek Parfit focuses on normative theories (and the aims they provide to agents), David McNaughton and Piers Rawling focus on rules and reasons, Skorupski on predicates, and there are other suggestions too. Some writers suspect that we fundamentally talk about one and the same distinction. This work is about practical reasons for action rather than theoretical reasons for belief. Moreover, focus is on whether reasons do or do not essentially refer to particular agents. A challenge that undermines the dichotomy in this sense is posed. After having rejected different attempts to defend the distinction, it is argued that there is a possible defence that sets out from Jonathan Dancy’s recent distinction between enablers and favourers.;
62;Pseudo-Randomness of Certain Sequences of k Symbols with Length pq;The theory of finite pseudo-random binary sequences was built by C. Mauduit and A. S´ark¨ozy and later extended to sequences of k symbols (or k-ary sequences). Certain constructions of pseudo-random sequences of k symbols were presented over finite fields in the literature. In this paper, two families of sequences of k symbols are constructed by using the integers modulo pq for distinct odd primes p and q. The upper bounds on the well-distribution measure and the correlation measure of the families sequences are presented in terms of certain character sums over modulo pq residue class rings. And low bounds on the linear complexity profile are also estimated.;
63;Revisiting the Censure Theory of Punishment;This paper is a rejoinder to Thaddeus Metz’s article “Censure Theory Still Best Accounts for Punishment of the Guilty: Reply to Montague.” In his article, Metz attempts to answer objections to censure theory that I had raised previously. I argue in my rejoinder that Metz’s defense of censure theory remains seriously problematic despite what he says in his reply.;
64;Software Agent with Reinforcement Learning Approach for Medical Image Segmentation;Many image segmentation solutions are problem-based. Medical images have very similar grey level and texture among the interested objects. Therefore, medical image segmentation requires improvements although there have been researches done since the last few decades. We design a self-learning framework to extract several objects of interest simultaneously from Computed Tomography (CT) images. Our segmentation method has a learning phase that is based on reinforcement learning (RL) system. Each RL agent works on a particular sub-image of an input image to find a suitable value for each object in it. The RL system is define by state, action and reward. We defined some actions for each state in the sub-image. A reward function computes reward for each action of the RL agent. Finally, the valuable information, from discovering all states of the interest objects, will be stored in a Q-matrix and the final result can be applied in segmentation of similar images. The experimental results for cranial CT images demonstrated segmentation accuracy above 95%.;
65;Software Defect Detection with ROCUS;Software defect detection aims to automatically identify defective software modules for efficient software test in order to improve the quality of a software system. Although many machine learning methods have been successfully applied to the task, most of them fail to consider two practical yet important issues in software defect detection. First, it is rather difficult to collect a large amount of labeled training data for learning a well-performing model second, in a software system there are usually much fewer defective modules than defect-free modules, so learning would have to be conducted over an imbalanced data set. In this paper, we address these two practical issues simultaneously by proposing a novel semi-supervised learning approach named Rocus. This method exploits the abundant unlabeled examples to improve the detection accuracy, as well as employs under-sampling to tackle the class-imbalance problem in the learning process. Experimental results of real-world software defect detection tasks show that Rocus is effective for software defect detection. Its performance is better than a semi-supervised learning method that ignores the class-imbalance nature of the task and a class-imbalance learning method that does not make effective use of unlabeled data.;
66;Source Code Prioritization Using Forward Slicing for Exposing Critical Elements in a Program;Even after thorough testing, a few bugs still remain in a program with moderate complexity. These residual bugs are randomly distributed throughout the code. We have noticed that bugs in some parts of a program cause frequent and severe failures compared to those in other parts. Then, it is necessary to take a decision about what to test more and what to test less within the testing budget. It is possible to prioritize the methods and classes of an object-oriented program according to their potential to cause failures. For this, we propose a program metric called influence metric to find the influence of a program element on the source code. First, we represent the source code into an intermediate graph called extended system dependence graph. Then, forward slicing is applied on a node of the graph to get the influence of that node. The influence metric for a method m in a program shows the number of statements of the program which directly or indirectly use the result produced by method m. We compute the influence metric for a class c based on the influence metric of all its methods. As influence metric is computed statically, it does not show the expected behavior of a class at run time. It is already known that faults in highly executed parts tend to more failures. Therefore, we have considered operational profile to find the average execution time of a class in a system. Then, classes are prioritized in the source code based on influence metric and average execution time. The priority of an element indicates the potential of the element to cause failures. Once all program elements have been prioritized, the testing effort can be apportioned so that the elements causing frequent failures will be tested thoroughly. We have conducted experiments for two well-known case studies — Library Management System and Trading Automation System — and successfully identified critical elements in the source code of each case study. We have also conducted experiments to compare our scheme with a related scheme. The experimental studies justify that our approach is more accurate than the existing ones in exposing critical elements at the implementation level.;
67;The Convergence of ˜γs(b0hn − h1bn−1)∗∗;This paper computes the Thom map on γ2 and proves that it is represented by 2b2,0h1,2 in the ASS. The authors also compute the higher May differential of b2,0, from which it is proved that ˜γs(b0hn − h1bn−1) for 2 ≤ s < p − 1 are permanent cycles in the ASS.;
68;The Limiting Behavior for Observations That Change with Time∗∗;Consider a system where units have random magnitude entering according to a homogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson process, while in the system, a unit’s magnitude may change with time. In this paper, the authors obtain some results for the limiting behavior of the sum process of all unit magnitudes present in the system at time t.;
69;Triangulation, Untranslatability, and Reconciliation;Donald Davidson used triangulation to do everything from explicate psychological and semantic externalism, to attack relativism and skepticism, to propose conditions necessary for thought and talk. At one point Davidson tried to bring order to these remarks by identifying three kinds of triangulation, each operative in a different situation. Here I take seriously Davidson’s talk of triangular situations and extend it. I start by describing Davidson’s situations. Next I establish the surprising result that considerations from one situation entail the possibility that at any one time one language is partially untranslatable into another. Because the possibility is time-indexed, it need not conflict with Davidson’s own argument against the possibility of untranslatability. I derive the result, not to indict Davidson, but to propose a new kind of triangulation, the reconciliation of untranslatability, which I investigate. Insofar as triangulation is central to Davidson’s views, getting a handle on his various triangular situations is key to getting a handle on his contributions to philosophy. Insofar as those contributions have enriched our understanding of how language, thought, and reality interrelate, extending Davidson’s model promises to extend our understanding too.;
70;Two New Families in the Stable Homotopy Groups of Sphere and Moore Spectrum∗∗;This paper proves the existence of an order p element in the stable homotopy group of sphere spectrum of degree p n q +p mq +q −4 and a nontrivial element in the stable homotopy group of Moore spectum of degree p n q + p mq + q − 3 which are represented by h0(hmbn−1 − hnbm−1) and i∗(h0hnhm) in the E2-terms of the Adams spectral sequence respectively, where p ≥ 7 is a prime, n ≥ m + 2 ≥ 4, q = 2(p − 1).;
71;A Class of Homogeneous Einstein Manifolds∗∗∗;A Riemannian manifold (M, g) is called Einstein manifold if its Ricci tensor satisfies r = c · g for some constant c. General existence results are hard to obtain, e.g., it is as yet unknown whether every compact manifold admits an Einstein metric. A natural approach is to impose additional homogeneous assumptions. M. Y. Wang and W. Ziller have got some results on compact homogeneous space G/H. They investigate standard homogeneous metrics, the metric induced by Killing form on G/H, and get some classification results. In this paper some more general homogeneous metrics on some homogeneous space G/H are studies, and a necessary and sufficient condition for this metric to be Einstein is given. The authors also give some examples of Einstein manifolds with non-standard homogeneous metrics.;
72;A Note on “Modules, Comodules, and Cotensor Products over Frobenius Algebras” ∗∗∗∗;This is a note on Abrams’ paper “Modules, Comodules, and Cotensor Products over Frobenius Algebras, Journal of Algebras” (1999). With the application of Frobenius coordinates developed recently by Kadison, one has a direct proof of Abrams’ characterization for Frobenius algebras in terms of comultiplication (see L. Kadison (1999)). For any Frobenius algebra, by using the explicit comultiplication, the explicit correspondence between the category of modules and the category of comodules is obtained. Moreover, with this we give very simplified proofs and improve Abrams’ results on the Hom functor description of cotensor functor.;
73;Asymptotic Behavior of Global Classical Solutions of Quasilinear Non-strictly Hyperbolic Systems with Weakly Linear Degeneracy∗∗;In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of global classical solutions of the Cauchy problem for general quasilinear hyperbolic systems with constant multiple and weakly linearly degenerate characteristic fields. Based on the existence of global classical solution proved by Zhou Yi et al., we show that, when t tends to infinity, the solution approaches a combination of C 1 travelling wave solutions, provided that the total variation and the L 1 norm of initial data are sufficiently small.;
74;Augmented Spinor Space∗∗;In this paper, based on the Pauli matrices, a notion of augmented spinor space is introduced, and a uniqueness of such augmented spinor space of rank n is proved. It may be expected that this new notion of spaces can be used in mathematical physics an geometry.;
75;Bifurcations of Invariant Tori and Subharmonic Solutions of Singularly Perturbed System∗∗∗;This paper deals with bifurcations of subharmonic solutions and invariant tori generated from limit cycles in the fast dynamics for a nonautonomous singularly perturbed system. Based on Poincar´e map, a series of blow-up transformations and the theory of integral manifold, the conditions for the existence of invariant tori are obtained, and the saddle-node bifurcations of subharmonic solutions are studied.;
76;Bott Generator and Its Application to an Almost Complex Structure on S6 ∗∗∗;The Bott generator of the homotopy group π2k−1U(∞) is used to construct an almost complex structure on S 6, which is integrable except a small neighborhood.;
77;Continuity of Weak Solutions for Quasilinear Parabolic Equations with Strong Degeneracy∗∗;The aim of this paper is to study the continuity of weak solutions for quasilinear degenerate parabolic equations of the form ut − ∆φ(u) = 0, where φ ∈ C1(R1) is a strictly monotone increasing function. Clearly, the above equation has strong degeneracy, i.e., the set of zero points of φ′( · ) is permitted to have zero measure. This is an answer to an open problem in [13, p. 288].;
78;Controllability of Non-densely Defined Neutral Functional Differential Systems in Abstract Space∗∗;In this paper, by means of Sadovskii fixed point theorem, the authors establish a result concerning the controllability for a class of abstract neutral functional differential systems where the linear part is non-densely defined and satisfies the Hille-Yosida condition. As an application, an example is provided to illustrate the obtained result.;
79;Curvature Estimates for Irreducible Symmetric Spaces;By making use of the classification of real simple Lie algebra, we get the maximum of the squared length of restricted roots case by case, and thus get the upper bounds of sectional curvature for irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces of compact type. As an application, this paper verifies Sampson’s conjecture in most cases for irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact type.;
80;Description, modelling and forecasting of data with optimal wavelets;Cascade processes have been used to model many different self-similar systems, as they are able to accurately describe most of their global statistical properties. The so-called optimal wavelet basis allows to achieve a geometrical representation of the cascade process-named microcanonical cascade- that describes the behavior of local quantities and thus it helps to reveal the underlying dynamics of the system. In this context, we study the benefits of using the optimal wavelet in contrast to other wavelets when used to define cascade variables, and we provide an optimality degree estimator that is appropriate to determine the closest-to-optimal wavelet in real data. Particularizing the analysis to stock market series, we show that they can be represented by microcanonical cascades in both the logarithm of the price and the volatility. Also, as a promising application in forecasting, we derive the distribution of the value of next point of the series conditioned to the knowledge of past points and the cascade structure, i.e., the stochastic kernel of the cascade process.;
81;Bifurcation of Homoclinic Orbits with Saddle-Center Equilibrium∗∗;In this paper, the authors develop new global perturbation techniques for detecting the persistence of transversal homoclinic orbits in a more general nondegenerated system with action-angle variable. The unperturbed system is assumed to have saddlecenter type equilibrium whose stable and unstable manifolds intersect in one dimensional manifold, and does not have to be completely integrable or near-integrable. By constructing local coordinate systems near the unperturbed homoclinic orbit, the conditions of existence of transversal homoclinic orbit are obtained, and the existence of periodic orbits bifurcated from homoclinic orbit is also considered.;
82;Blow Up of Solutions to Semilinear Wave Equations with Critical Exponent in High Dimensions∗∗;In this paper, the author considers the Cauchy problem for semilinear wave equations with critical exponent in n ≥ 4 space dimensions. Under some positivity conditions on the initial data, it is proved that there can be no global solutions no matter how small the initial data are.;
83;Convergence Rate to Stationary Solutions for Boltzmann Equation with External Force∗∗∗∗;For the Boltzmann equation with an external force in the form of the gradient of a potential function in space variable, the stability of its stationary solutions as local Maxwellians was studied by S. Ukai et al. (2005) through the energy method. Based on this stability analysis and some techniques on analyzing the convergence rates to stationary solutions for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, in this paper, we study the convergence rate to the above stationary solutions for the Boltzmann equation which is a fundamental equation in statistical physics for non-equilibrium rarefied gas. By combining the dissipation from the viscosity and heat conductivity on the fluid components and the dissipation on the non-fluid component through the celebrated H-theorem, a convergence rate of the same order as the one for the compressible Navier-Stokes is obtained by constructing some energy functionals.;
84;Corrected Nonconservative Schemes;Derivatives of discontinuities being Dirac singularities, it is usually not possible to multiply them by discontinuous functions. However in the context of conservation laws we have shown in a recent paper that it can be done. We shall make use of this new framework to revisit some upwind methods, mostly characteristic schemes, and show that they can be corrected to be conservative and to work on difficult problems such as Euler’s equations for fluids. Numerous numerical results are given.;
85;Distribution of Primitive λ-Roots of Composite Moduli II∗∗∗;We improve estimates for the distribution of primitive λ-roots of a composite modulus q yielding an asymptotic formula for the number of primitive λ-roots in any interval I of length |I| ≫ q 12 +ǫ. Similar results are obtained for the distribution of ordered pairs (x, x−1) with x a primitive λ-root, and for the number of primitive λ-roots satisfying inequalities such as |x − x −1| ≤ B.;
86;Exact Controllability and Asymptotic Analysis for Shallow Shells;the authors consider the exact controllability of the vibrations of a thin shallow shell, of thickness 2ǫ with controls imposed on the lateral surface and at the top and bottom of the shell. Apart from proving the existence of exact controls, it is shown that the solutions of the three dimensional exact controllability problems converge, as the thickness of the shell goes to zero, to the solution of an exact controllability problem in two dimensions.;
87;Existence and Asymptotic Behavior of Radially Symmetric Solutions to a Semilinear Hyperbolic System in Odd Space Dimensions∗∗∗;This paper is concerned with a class of semilinear hyperbolic systems in odd space dimensions. Our main aim is to prove the existence of a small amplitude solution which is asymptotic to the free solution as t → −∞ in the energy norm, and to show it has a free profile as t → +∞. Our approach is based on the work of [11]. Namely we use a weighted L∞ norm to get suitable a priori estimates. This can be done by restricting our attention to radially symmetric solutions. Corresponding initial value problem is also considered in an analogous framework. Besides, we give an extended result of [14] for three space dimensional case in Section 5, which is prepared independently of the other parts of the paper.;
88;Global Bifurcation of a Perturbed Double-Homoclinic Loop∗∗∗;This paper deals with a kind of fourth degree systems with perturbations. By using the method of multi-parameter perturbation theory and qualitative analysis, it is proved that the system can have six limit cycles;
89;Global Existence of Classical Solutions for Some Oldroyd-B Model via the Incompressible Limit∗∗;In this paper, we prove local and global existence of classical solutions for a system of equations concerning an incompressible viscoelastic fluid of Oldroyd-B type via the incompressible limit when the initial data are sufficiently small.;
90;Homogenization of Reynolds Equation by Two-Scale Convergence;To increase the hydrodynamic performance in different machine elements, as e.g. journal bearings and thrust bearings, during lubrication it is important to understand the influence of surface roughness. In this connection one encounters homogenization of the incompressible Reynolds equation, where the roughness of the lubricated surface is assumed to be periodic. This problem has recently been studied in more engineeringoriented papers by using the formal method of multiple scale expansion. In this paper, we rigorously prove both homogenization and corrector results by using two-scale convergence, which may be regarded as a justification of the formal multiple scale expansion method described above. Moreover, some numerical illustrations and results are presented.;
